 * Context-window size estimates for the Context Budget Guard.
 *
 * Unlike `lib/usage/pricing.ts`, the numbers below are NOT published,
 * contractual facts. Per `docs/releases/v2.5.0.md` ("Where the model facts
 * came from"), the context window OpenAI's published API docs advertise is
 * for the API surface, not the ChatGPT Codex backend this wrapper actually
 * talks to — and the docs pages don't even agree with each other. Treating a
 * hardcoded number here as ground truth would repeat that exact mistake for
 * a safety feature, which is worse than not shipping the feature at all.
 *
 * So this table is a fallback starting point ONLY. `getEffectiveContextWindow`
 * always prefers a caller-supplied override (from
 * `contextBudgetGuardModelWindowOverrides`, the setting a user fills in once
 * they know their real ceiling) over anything listed here.
 */

 * Best-effort estimates, in tokens. Deliberately conservative: an estimate
 * that is too LOW makes the guard fire early (annoying, safe); an estimate
 * that is too HIGH makes the guard fire late or never (silent, unsafe). When
 * in doubt about a model's real ceiling, leave it out of this table and add
 * it to UNESTIMATED_ROUTABLE_MODELS instead.

 * file's table — Codex CLI's own default is `gpt-5-codex`, and every
 * reasoning-suffixed alias (`gpt-5.3-codex-high`, …) is an alias-map entry
 * rather than a catalog model. Looking up only the raw string made the guard
 * silently return "no window, skip" for the most common model in the product.
 *
 * So: try the raw (lowercased) string first, so a user override keyed exactly
 * the way they type the model still wins, then the catalog's canonical id for
 * it. `getNormalizedModel` is deliberately the exact/alias-only resolver —
 * `resolveNormalizedModel` falls back to `DEFAULT_MODEL` for anything it does
 * not recognize, which would hand an unknown model gpt-5.5's window and
